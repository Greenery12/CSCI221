This was the final project for my CSCI 221 class I took fall of 2024. This priject is a variation of the prisoners dilema. 
In this game there are 2 players. Each choose to give or take at the same time. If both give, each player gets 1 point.
If both take each get 0 points. If 1 give and the other takes, the one that took gets 3 points while the one that gave gets 0 points. 
The goal is to get the most amount of points in 50 rounds. This program has 10 different algorithms which play against each other. 
The user chooses 1 algorithm and it playes against all 10, including itself. 

Discription of each algorithm:

(1) AlwaysGive: this program will always give.

(2) AlwaysTake: This program will always take.
